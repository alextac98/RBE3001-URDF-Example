# MATLAB URDF Example for WPI RBE 3001 Arm

## MATLAB URDF Import: 
There are two ways to do this:
1. Import URDF as a rigidBodyTree. Read more here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ref/importrobot.html#d118e30072
2. Import the URDF as a Simscape Multibody using `simimport`. You then can use the benefits of a Simscape Multibody, including computing kinematics. Read more about this method here: https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sm/ug/urdf-import.html
